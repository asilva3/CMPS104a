Overview
Augment your string table manager from the previous project by adding to it a scanner
written in flex. Continue to use the module auxlib. Include token creation routines
in the modules astree, auxlib, and lyutils from Assignments/util-code.

SYNOPSIS
oc [-ly] [-@ flag . . .] [-D string] program.oc
For this project, given an input file called program.oc, you will generate output files
called program.str (as before) and also program.tok. All specifications from project
1 apply to this project. In addition, the -l flag must turn on yy_flex_debug.
