This program was completed using pair programing.
Partner: Kevin Thai(kjthai@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Armando Silva(asilva3@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programing pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effor for an assignment should be
spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. THe object is to work together,
learning from each other, not to divide the work into two pieces 
with each partner working on a different piece. 

Kevin Thai spent        __1_ hours working alone.
Armando Silva spent     __1_ hours working alone.
We spent                __4_ hours working together.
Kevin Thai spent        __2_ hours driving.
Armando Silva spent     __2_ hours driving.
