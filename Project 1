Overview

Write a main program for the language oc that will be compiled.
Also, include a string set ADT for it, and make it preprocess the program using the
C preprocessor, /usr/bin/cpp. The main program will be called from Unix according
the usage given below under the synopsis. This means that your compiler will read
in a single oc program, possibly with some options, as described below.
The name of the compiler is oc and the file extension for programs written in this
language will be .oc as well. Option letters are given with the usual Unix syntax.
All debugging output should be printed to the standard error, not the standard output.
Use the macros DEBUGF and DEBUGSTMT to generate debug output.
